# JELOS theme for SimpleMenu
This theme draws heavily upon the style inspired by Art Book Next (credit: anthonycaccese) which is the default theme for JustEnoughLinux OS (JELOS)

*I highly recommend that you reorder your emulator links to match the flow in the backdrops*


## Installation Instructions

- Download the zip file from https://github.com/stranaha/JELOS-simplemenu/releases/tag/latest
- Extract the JELOS folder to your computer
- Copy the JELOS folder to the \gmenu2x\skins folder on your device's SD card
- That's it!


### Fonts

You can modify the font and size used to display gamelists

- Download your font of choice (must be a .ttf file)
- Rename it 'font.ttf'
- Upload it to the root of the JELOS folder, overwriting the original file
- Once copied to your device, you can change the font size in skin.conf or through your device's theme menu
